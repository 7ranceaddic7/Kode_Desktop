Kode - The kOS IDE  
  
Kode is an IDE for the Kerbal Space Program mod kOS which acts as a scriptable autopilot.  
The goal of Kode is ever changing, but by Version 1.0 I aim to make it a powerful IDE with full compilation and debugging, Script simulation and flight profile visualisation.  
Kode is released under the GPL V3 licence and incorporates components and libraries licenced under the MIT licence.
